Sri Lanka’s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 279.8 millimetres in the northern province particularly in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts. During this period two deaths have been reported in Jaffna district and the Government of Sri Lanka has declared a local level emergency in the Northern Province, hence schools and other institutions in the province were closed. The continuous rains are still inundating most of the low-lying areas in the two districts and have caused damages to residential areas. As this situation is intensifying, agricultural lands and standing crops are also inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. As of 10th December, It is expected that this heavy rainfall is going to continue, which will have an impact and further exacerbate the capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report, as of 8 December 2020, 111,659 people (33,316 families) have been affected across 14 districts. According to the report, 106 houses are fully damaged, and 3,783 houses are partially damaged. A total of 15 evacuation centres are activated and 232 families are located in these centres.

The volcano is located in the northern part of Lembata island, East Nusa Tenggara (Nusa Tenggara Timur– NTT) Province. An alert Level 3 warrants a danger zone of up to 4 kilometres from the volcano since there is the potential for further eruptions. \n\nFrom Friday, 27 November 2020 to Thursday, 3 December 2020, Ili Lewotolok Volcano recorded 27 eruptions. PVMBG observed the height of the ash column between 200 – 4,000 meters above the peak of the volcano and advised people in the vicinity of Ili Lewotolok Volcano to keep a safe distance because the volcano spews volcanic bombs in all directions. Moreover, heavy ash fall was reported in areas close to the volcano. PVMBG further warned the public of the dangers of exposure to volcanic materials, such as eye injuries, suffocation, and respiratory problems. \n\nOn 1 December 2020, Lembata Distict government declared a Disaster Emergency Alert (Tanggap Darurat Bencana) within its administrative area. At the time of writing, there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage due to the eruptions. Nevertheless, at least 7,968 people from 17 villages in Ile Ape sub-district and nine villages in Ile Ape Timur Sub-district had been evacuated. The evacuees are dispersed across 13 evacuation centres in Lembata District. ([IFRC, 9 Dec 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3695549))', '2024-11-08 04:49:53', 'ReliefWeb', 'Unknown'),
(803, 'Hurricane Iota - Nov 2020', 'Millions suffering from [Eta](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/tc-2020-000220-hnd)’s consequences are now on the brink of facing a second major storm in as many weeks, with Hurricane Iota bearing down on Central America’s Caribbean coasts on a path virtually identical to that of Eta and setting up a potentially catastrophic scenario upon its projected landfall as a Category 5 storm. Iota, the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season’s 30th named storm, is currently a Category 4 hurricane featuring maximum sustained winds of 245 km/h and is forecast to bring rainfall of up to 400mm in Honduras, northern Nicaragua, Guatemala and southern Belize. These conditions will bring significant, life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding, along with landslides in higher elevation areas, risks that are compounded by high soil saturations from Eta. ([OCHA, 17 Nov 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3688613))     \n\nHurricane Iota made landfall over northern Nicaragua early on 17 November as a Category 4 storm, reaching sufficient intensity to qualify as the strongest Atlantic hurricane in 2020, the busiest season ever recorded and the only season ever to see two major hurricanes in November. Although Iota has since degraded to remnants of a tropical depression, persistent rains over areas reeling from Eta\'s impact have caused added flooding and landslides, increasing official counts of people affected and people in shelters in various countries and growing government-led response efforts to account for the newly affected.

Normally, the Sept/Oct—Dec rainy season is expected to start in late September in the northern parts and mid October in the southern areas of the country. The Ethiopian highlands, which contribute to the Juba and Shabelle river flow, continued to receive moderate rains over the last one week. ([FAO, 24 Sep 2020](https://reliefweb.int/node/3672960))\n\nThe 2020 Deyr rainy season has started with moderate to significantly heavy rains reported in Puntland and central regions of Hiraan, Bakool, Galgaduud, Mudug, Nugaal and southern areas of Sool region. The communities living in the riverine areas along Juba and Shabelle rivers are at high risk of flooding. As heavy rains are expected to continue in November and December, scaling up of livelihoods, improving and supporting health services and WASH facilities is vital in order to prevent further deterioration in food security and escalation of the public health crisis.
