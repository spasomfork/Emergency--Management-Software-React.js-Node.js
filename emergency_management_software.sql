Despite the national EAR Watch’s climate outlook forecasting normal rainfall for the coming months, the likelihood of Tuvalu proceeding to serious or severely dry conditions remains high. Preparedness and early actions are advisable given past and future seasonal data. Tuvalu relies almost solely on rainwater for consumption, indicating that continued monitoring and data collection would be of high value, as the situation can deteriorate rapidly. \n\nTuvalu National Drought Committee (DC) was activated on 5 July, and agreed to meet weekly to provide updates on both thresholds (rainfall received and government water reserves). The Ministry of Public Works established seven water distribution points which have been operational since 12 July on Funafuti, where all households are able to collect six buckets of water (approximately 60 liters per household per day) ... Worthy to note, the 2011 drought resulted in widespread sickness due to a decrease in handwashing, low household water reserves that increased pathogen concentrations, and a switch to untreated or less hygienic water sources. As Tuvalu is in its dry season till October, there is an impressed need to consider the early actions that may be required, and the data needed to implement those early actions, in support of the most affected islands that may face water challenges.\n ([IFRC, 24 Aug 2021](https://reliefweb.int/node/3768014))', '2024-11-02 17:13:19', 'ReliefWeb', 'Unknown'),

To date, the causes of the fire are still unclear. There was no Fire Department in the affected areas. Therefore, there was not a speedy response to the incident. According to reports from the Permanent Contingency Commission (COPECO), the fire was 100% controlled around 11:00 a.m. on 2 October, thanks to the deployment of firefighters from the near island of Roatan (located between the islands of Útila and Guanaja) and the regions near the coast of the country of La Ceiba and Tegucigalpa, including members of the Honduran Naval Force and Air Force, which provided boats and helicopters to quell the spread of the fire. There is a long distance, between Guanaja and the main cities; hence supporting a speedy response was not possible (Guanaja – La Ceiba 123 km, Guanaja – Tegucigalpa 299 km).\n\nDue to the proximity of the houses and wood as main construction material, the fire spread quickly, affecting approximately half of the territorial extension of El Cayo.
